          <p>"Smash is jazz.  Everything else is classical music.  You can have the sheet music in front of you and it's all about your execution because you know what sound is going to come out.  Jazz, you got to play some improv in there.  You know those scales.  You know what notes you want to hit.  Can you hit them on time and if not what can you do with it."</p>
